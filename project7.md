## Step 1 – Prepare NFS Server

Spin up a new EC2 instance with RHEL Linux 8 Operating System.

Based on your LVM experience from Project 6, Configure LVM on the Server.

Instead of formating the disks as ext4 you will have to format them as xfs

Ensure there are 3 Logical Volumes. lv-opt lv-apps, and lv-logs

Create mount points on /mnt directory for the logical volumes as follow:

Mount lv-apps on /mnt/apps – To be used by webservers

Mount lv-logs on /mnt/logs – To be used by webserver logs

Mount lv-opt on /mnt/opt – To be used by Jenkins server in Project 8

Install NFS server, configure it to start on reboot and make sure it is u and running

```bash
sudo yum -y update
sudo yum install nfs-utils -y
sudo systemctl start nfs-server.service
sudo systemctl enable nfs-server.service
sudo systemctl status nfs-server.service
```
