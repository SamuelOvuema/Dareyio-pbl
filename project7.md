## Step 1 – Prepare NFS Server

1. Spin up a new EC2 instance with RHEL Linux 8 Operating System.

2. Based on your LVM experience from Project 6, Configure LVM on the Server.

Instead of formating the disks as ext4 you will have to format them as xfs

Ensure there are 3 Logical Volumes. lv-opt lv-apps, and lv-logs

Create mount points on /mnt directory for the logical volumes as follow:

Mount lv-apps on /mnt/apps – To be used by webservers

Mount lv-logs on /mnt/logs – To be used by webserver logs

Mount lv-opt on /mnt/opt – To be used by Jenkins server in Project 8

3. Install NFS server, configure it to start on reboot and make sure it is u and running

```bash
sudo yum -y update
sudo yum install nfs-utils -y
sudo systemctl start nfs-server.service
sudo systemctl enable nfs-server.service
sudo systemctl status nfs-server.service
```

Export the mounts for webservers’ subnet cidr to connect as clients. For simplicity, you will install your all three Web Servers inside the same subnet, but in production set up you would probably want to separate each tier inside its own subnet for higher level of security.

To check your subnet cidr – open your EC2 details in AWS web console and locate ‘Networking’ tab and open a Subnet link:
