## MEAN STACK IMPLEMENTATION

Now, that you have already learned how to deploy LAMP, LEMP and MERN Web stacks – it is time to familiarise yourself with the MEAN stack and deploy it to the Ubuntu server.

MEAN Stack is a combination of the following components:

1. MongoDB (Document database) – Stores and allows retrieval of data.
2. Express (Back-end application framework) – Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
3. Angular (Front-end application framework) – Handles Client and Server Requests
4. Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment) – Accepts requests and displays results to end user

Step 0 – Preparing prerequisites
In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.

If you do not have an AWS account – go back to Project 1 Step 0 to sign in to AWS free tier account and create a new EC2 Instance of the t2.nano family with an Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM) image. Remember, you can have multiple EC2 instances, but make sure you STOP the ones you are not working with at the moment to save available free hours.
